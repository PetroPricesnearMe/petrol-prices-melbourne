## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Current Issues
1. ❌ API tokens exposed in frontend code
2. ❌ No rate limiting on client side
3. ⚠️ CORS proxy allows any origin

### Recommendations
1. Move tokens to backend exclusively
2. Implement client-side request throttling
3. Use backend as sole API proxy
4. Add authentication layer
5. Implement proper CSRF protection

---

## 📝 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```
- Test DataSourceManager functions
- Test data transformation logic
- Test coordinate validation
- Test error handling

### Integration Tests
```bash
node test-frontend-health.js
```
- Test API endpoints
- Test data flow
- Test error scenarios
- Test network failures

### E2E Tests (Recommended)
```bash
npm run test:e2e  # After setup
```
- Test complete user flows
- Test map interactions
- Test station filtering
- Test error recovery

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test with slow network (throttling)
- [ ] Test with network offline
- [ ] Test with invalid tokens
- [ ] Test with backend down
- [ ] Test with malformed API responses
- [ ] Test memory leaks (long session)

2. ✅ Use error boundaries for crash protection
3. ✅ Implement fallback mechanisms
4. ✅ Separate concerns (UI vs logic)
5. ✅ Use TypeScript for backend (already done)

### Performance
1. ✅ Memoize expensive computations
2. ✅ Use code splitting (already done)
3. ✅ Validate data to prevent bad renders
