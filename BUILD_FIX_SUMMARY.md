# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tailwind CSS PostCSS Error ✅
**Error:**
```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. 
The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package...
```

**Solution:**
- Removed unused `tailwindcss` package (project uses custom CSS, not Tailwind)
- Deleted empty `postcss.config.js` file
- Deleted empty `tailwind.config.js` file

**Result:** Build now compiles successfully without errors.

---

### 2. CSS Linting Error ✅
**Error:**
```
Also define the standard property 'flex' for compatibility
```
**Location:** `src/styles/cross-browser-utils.css:271`

**Solution:**
Added standard `flex` property before vendor-prefixed `-ms-flex`:
```css
.station-card {
  flex: 1 1 300px;        /* Standard property (added) */
  -ms-flex: 1 1 300px;    /* IE11 vendor prefix */
}
```

### 3. ESLint Warnings ✅
**Warnings:**
- `'getFuelIcon' is assigned a value but never used`
- `'formatLastUpdated' is assigned a value but never used`

**Solution:**
Removed unused utility functions from `src/components/StationCards.js`.

### 4. Brand Logo Images Updated ✅
Created fresh SVG brand logos in `public/images/brands/`:

- ✅ `shell.svg` - Yellow/gold with red accents
- ✅ `bp.svg` - Green with yellow/white sunburst
- ✅ `7-eleven.svg` - Orange/red with green accent
- ✅ `caltex.svg` - Red with white star
- ✅ `ampol.svg` - Red with white lightning bolt
- ✅ `united.svg` - Blue with white diamond
- ✅ `apco.svg` - Orange with white arrow

All logos are:
- Modern SVG format (scalable, crisp)
- Optimized for web performance
- Brand-accurate colors
