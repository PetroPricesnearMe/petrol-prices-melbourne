# ðŸš€ Deployment Environment Variables

## âœ… **Map is Now Fixed!**

Your Mapbox token has been configured and the application has been rebuilt. The map should now work perfectly!

### **Testing Locally**
The development server is now running. Open your browser and go to:
- **Homepage**: http://localhost:3000
- **Map Page**: http://localhost:3000/map

### **Required Environment Variables for Production Deployment**

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), you need to set these environment variables:

```bash
# CRITICAL - Map won't work without this
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoicGV0cm9scHJpY2VzIiwiYSI6ImNtZW82a2ZkbzEzZzEycHB4bnN2a3d6MWYifQ.hOEEwKVHFhA2_IAxvj59SA

# Baserow API Configuration
REACT_APP_BASEROW_TOKEN=WXGOdiCeNmvdj5NszzAdvIug3InwQQXP
REACT_APP_BASEROW_API_URL=https://api.baserow.io/api

# Google Analytics (replace with your actual ID)
REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## **Deployment Instructions by Platform**

### **Vercel**
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable above
4. Redeploy your application

### **Netlify**
1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add each variable above
3. Trigger a new deploy

### **GitHub Pages (with GitHub Actions)**
1. Go to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
2. Add each variable as a repository secret
3. Update your workflow to use these secrets

### **Manual Deployment**
If deploying manually, create a `.env.production` file with the variables above before building:
```bash
npm run build
```

## **Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Map loads with Melbourne location centered
- [ ] Petrol stations appear as markers
- [ ] Clicking markers shows popup with prices
- [ ] Fuel type selector works
- [ ] Station clustering works at different zoom levels
- [ ] Get Directions button opens Google Maps

## **Troubleshooting**

### If map still doesn't load:
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check browser console** for errors (F12)
3. **Verify token** is being loaded: 
   - In browser console, check if `process.env.REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` exists
4. **Check Network tab** for failed Mapbox API calls

### Common Issues:
- **"Invalid access token"**: Token might be incorrect or expired
- **Map tiles not loading**: Check internet connection and Mapbox service status
- **Markers not showing**: Baserow API might be down or data format changed

## **Important Notes**
- The `.env.local` file is only for local development
- Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in .gitignore)
- Always use environment variables in production hosting platforms
- The token provided is tied to the "petrolprices" Mapbox account

## **Success Indicators**
âœ… Build completed successfully
âœ… Token is configured in .env.local
âœ… Application rebuilt with token embedded
âœ… Development server is running
âœ… Map should now be fully functional!
