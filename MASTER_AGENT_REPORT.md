2. **DATA** - File integrity and format validation
3. **ENV** - Environment variable configuration
4. **SERVER** - Server file presence and validity
5. **DATABASE** - Database connectivity
6. **ASSETS** - Public asset verification
7. **DEPENDENCIES** - Package installation status

---

## 📈 Usage Instructions

### For Developers

**Run a quick health check:**
```bash
npm run monitor
```

**Start continuous monitoring:**
```bash
npm run monitor:watch
```

**View reports:**
- Open `scripts/report-viewer.html` in browser
- Check `logs/backend-reports/latest.json`

### For DevOps

**Deploy as background service:**
```bash
pm2 start scripts/backend-monitor-scheduler.js --name "backend-monitor"
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

**Monitor service:**
```bash
pm2 logs backend-monitor
pm2 status
```

**Configure master agent:**
```env
# Add to .env.local
MASTER_AGENT_URL=https://your-master-agent.com/api/reports
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Scan Interval

Default: **30 minutes** (1,800,000 ms)

Change in `scripts/backend-monitor-scheduler.js`:
```javascript
const SCAN_INTERVAL_MS = 30 * 60 * 1000;
```

### Master Agent Endpoint

Set in `.env.local`:
```env
MASTER_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/master-agent-report
```

Without this, reports are logged locally only.
