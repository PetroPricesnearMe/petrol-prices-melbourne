Description: The petrol stations were digitized in 2011/2012 from the library of imagery held within Geoscience Australia. Imagery used ranged from 0.15m to 2.5m resolution. The first version of this database was subsequently released on the GA website in March 2015. The Liquid Fuel Refineries Database was reviewed and subsequently revised in August 2022 using a number of state based APIs.
