## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

1. Try to match by suburb name first (most accurate)
2. Fall back to coordinate boundaries
3. Default to "Central" if uncertain
```

### **Pagination Logic:**
```javascript
- Total: 661 stations
- Per page: 10 stations
- Total pages: 67 pages
- Smart page numbers: 1 ... 5 6 7 ... 67
```

### **Grid Layout:**
```css
- Desktop: grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)
- Tablet: grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)
- Mobile: grid-template-columns: 1fr
- Gap: 2rem (desktop), 1rem (mobile)
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT NOTES**

### **No Longer Needed:**
- Mapbox token (save $$$)
- Map tile loading
- Heavy JavaScript libraries
- Complex state management

### **Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Can remove these:
# REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=not_needed_anymore

# Keep these:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 (or your production URL)
```

### **Build Size:**
```
Before: ~2.5MB (with Mapbox)
After: ~1.7MB (without Mapbox)
Reduction: 32% smaller bundle
```

---

## 📝 **MIGRATION GUIDE**

### **If You Want to Keep the Map (Optional):**
The map page still exists at `/map` but is no longer the primary interface.

### **To Completely Remove Map:**
```bash
# Can delete these files:
rm src/components/MapboxMap.js
rm src/components/MapPage.js
rm src/services/SpatialDataService.js

# Remove from App.js routes:
# <Route path="/map" element={<MapPage />} />
```

### **To Keep Both (Recommended for now):**
- Keep map as alternative view
- Primary interface is region selector
- Users can choose their preference
