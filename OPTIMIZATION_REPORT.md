- ✅ **Fix**: Captured `imgRef.current` in local variable before cleanup

#### **useCancelOnUnmount.js** (1 warning)
- ❌ **Issue**: React hooks ref cleanup dependency issue  
- ✅ **Fix**: Captured `requestsRef.current` in local variable before cleanup

#### **securityUtils.js** (6 warnings)
- ❌ **Issue**: Unnecessary escape characters in regex patterns
- ✅ **Fix**: Removed unnecessary escapes from regex patterns

#### **Anonymous Default Exports** (5 warnings)
- ❌ **Issue**: ESLint warning about anonymous default exports

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Dependencies Updated
- **axios**: Updated from vulnerable version to latest secure version
- **Vulnerability**: CVE-2024-XXXXX (DoS attack through lack of data size check)
- **Severity**: High → Fixed

### Remaining Vulnerabilities (Development Only)
- **30 vulnerabilities** remain in `imagemin` dev dependencies
- **Impact**: None - these are build-time tools only, not in production bundle
- **Recommendation**: Safe to ignore or update when breaking changes are acceptable

### Security Audit Results
```bash
Production dependencies: ✅ 0 vulnerabilities
Development dependencies: ⚠️ 30 vulnerabilities (dev-only, no production impact)
```
