# 🚀 Multi-Agent Development - Quick Start Guide
## Melbourne Petrol Stations Project

### ✅ **What We've Accomplished**

Your project is now organized into **4 specialized domains** with dedicated agent rules:

```
✅ Project Categorization Complete
├── 🎨 Frontend/UI Domain
├── 🔧 Backend/API Domain  
├── 🗄️ Database/Config Domain
└── 🧪 Testing/CI-CD Domain

✅ Agent Rules Created
├── .cursor/rules/frontend.mdc
├── .cursor/rules/backend.mdc
├── .cursor/rules/database-config.mdc
└── .cursor/rules/testing-cicd.mdc

✅ Documentation & Guides

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Create Parallel Branches**
```bash
# Create feature branches for each domain
git checkout -b feature/frontend-improvements
git checkout -b feature/backend-optimization
git checkout -b feature/database-migration
git checkout -b feature/testing-setup

# Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

### **Step 2: Open 4 Cursor Sessions**

#### **🎨 Frontend Agent Session**
1. **Open new Cursor window**
2. **Load project** and switch to `feature/frontend-improvements`
3. **Use this prompt:**

```
You are the Frontend Agent for Melbourne Petrol Stations.

STRICT LIMITATIONS:
- You are responsible ONLY for files in src/components/**, src/pages/**, src/styles/**, src/hooks/**, src/utils/**, public/**, and tests/unit/frontend/**
- NEVER alter backend/**, config/**, or .github/workflows/**

Focus on:
- React component development and optimization
- UI/UX improvements and responsive design
- Frontend performance and accessibility
- Component testing with React Testing Library

Current task: Reorganize components by domain and improve performance.
```

#### **🔧 Backend Agent Session**
1. **Open new Cursor window**
2. **Load project** and switch to `feature/backend-optimization`
3. **Use this prompt:**

```
You are the Backend Agent for Melbourne Petrol Stations.

STRICT LIMITATIONS:
- You are responsible ONLY for files in backend/**, tests/unit/backend/**, tests/integration/**, and scripts/backend/**
- NEVER alter src/components/**, src/pages/**, or frontend code

Focus on:
- API endpoint development and optimization
- Business logic and external service integrations
- Server performance, security, and error handling
- Backend testing (unit and integration)

Current task: Implement layered architecture and improve API performance.
```

#### **🗄️ Database/Config Agent Session**
1. **Open new Cursor window**
2. **Load project** and switch to `feature/database-migration`
3. **Use this prompt:**

```
You are the Database/Config Agent for Melbourne Petrol Stations.

STRICT LIMITATIONS:
- You are responsible ONLY for files in config/**, data/**, env.example, .env.*, backend/src/config/**, backend/src/types/**
- NEVER alter application logic, UI components, or CI/CD pipelines

Focus on:
- Database schema design and data models
- Environment variable and configuration management
- TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas
- Migration scripts and data integrity

Current task: Organize configurations and define comprehensive data models.
```

#### **🧪 Testing/CI-CD Agent Session**
1. **Open new Cursor window**
2. **Load project** and switch to `feature/testing-setup`
3. **Use this prompt:**

```
You are the Testing & CI/CD Agent for Melbourne Petrol Stations.

STRICT LIMITATIONS:
- You are responsible ONLY for files in tests/**, .github/workflows/**, scripts/test/**, scripts/deploy/**, cypress/**, jest.config.js, cypress.config.js
- NEVER alter application logic, UI components, or business code

Focus on:
- Test infrastructure setup (Jest, Cypress, React Testing Library)
- CI/CD pipeline development with GitHub Actions
- Quality assurance automation and deployment
- Performance and accessibility testing

Current task: Set up comprehensive testing framework and CI/CD pipelines.
```

## 🔄 **Parallel Workflow Process**

### **Week 1: Independent Development**
Each agent works on their branch:

```bash
# Each agent in their respective branch
Frontend Agent:    feature/frontend-improvements
Backend Agent:     feature/backend-optimization  
Database Agent:    feature/database-migration
Testing Agent:     feature/testing-setup
```

**Daily Tasks:**
- **Frontend:** Component reorganization, performance optimization
- **Backend:** API improvements, business logic refactoring
- **Database:** Schema design, configuration management
- **Testing:** Test setup, CI/CD pipeline creation

### **Week 2: Coordination & Integration**

#### **Day 1-2: Documentation Phase**
Each agent documents their changes:

```markdown
# api-changes.md (Backend Agent)
## New API Endpoints
- GET /api/stations?page=1&limit=20 (added pagination)
- POST /api/stations/:id/favorite (new favorite feature)

# component-changes.md (Frontend Agent)  
## New Components
- StationCard: Added favorite functionality
- PaginationControls: New pagination component

# schema-changes.md (Database Agent)
## New Data Models
- UserPreferences: For storing user favorites
- Station: Updated with new fields

# test-changes.md (Testing Agent)
## New Test Suites
- E2E tests for station search and favorites
- API integration tests for new endpoints
```

#### **Day 3-4: Code Review Phase**
Cross-agent code reviews:

```bash
# Create pull requests for review
git checkout feature/frontend-improvements
gh pr create --title "Frontend: Component reorganization and performance improvements"

git checkout feature/backend-optimization  
gh pr create --title "Backend: API optimization and layered architecture"

git checkout feature/database-migration
gh pr create --title "Database: Schema updates and configuration management"

git checkout feature/testing-setup
gh pr create --title "Testing: Comprehensive test infrastructure setup"
```

#### **Day 5: Integration & Merge**
Merge in dependency order:

```bash
# 1. Database/Config first (foundation)
git checkout develop
git merge feature/database-migration

# 2. Backend (depends on config)
git merge feature/backend-optimization

# 3. Frontend (depends on backend APIs)  
git merge feature/frontend-improvements

# 4. Testing last (tests everything)
git merge feature/testing-setup

# 5. Final integration test
npm run test:all
npm run build
```

- [ ] No merge conflicts with other branches

### **Integration Validation:**
- [ ] Frontend can consume backend API changes
- [ ] Backend uses updated configuration correctly
- [ ] All tests pass in CI pipeline
- [ ] Application builds and deploys successfully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained

## 🛠️ **Helpful Commands**

### **Branch Management:**
```bash
# Check status of all agent branches
git branch -a | grep feature/

# Quick switch between agent contexts
git checkout feature/frontend-improvements    # Frontend work
git checkout feature/backend-optimization     # Backend work  
git checkout feature/database-migration       # Database work
git checkout feature/testing-setup            # Testing work
```

### **Integration Testing:**
```bash
# Run cross-domain integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Check for type compatibility across domains
npm run type-check

# Validate build with all changes
npm run build
```

### **Agent Status Check:**
```bash
# See what each agent has been working on
git log --oneline -5 feature/frontend-improvements
git log --oneline -5 feature/backend-optimization
git log --oneline -5 feature/database-migration  
git log --oneline -5 feature/testing-setup
```

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Development Velocity:**
- **Parallel Development:** 4x faster feature development
- **Reduced Conflicts:** <2 merge conflicts per week
- **Faster Reviews:** Domain experts review relevant code
- **Quality Improvement:** Each agent becomes domain expert

### **Code Quality:**
- **Test Coverage:** >80% maintained across all domains
- **Performance:** No regressions in Core Web Vitals
- **Security:** Automated security scanning in CI
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained

---

## 🚨 **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### **❌ DON'T:**
- Modify files outside your agent's glob patterns
- Make breaking changes without coordinating with other agents
- Skip documentation when changes affect other domains
- Merge without proper code review and testing
- Work in complete isolation without communication

### **✅ DO:**
- Stay strictly within your defined file scope
- Document all changes that affect other agents
- Use conventional commit messages with domain scope
- Communicate early and often about dependencies
- Run tests before committing and merging
