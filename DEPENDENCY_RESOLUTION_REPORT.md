# Dependency Resolution Report

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Project:** Melbourne Petrol Stations (PPNM)

---

## Problem Summary

The project encountered npm peer dependency conflicts when attempting to install packages. The root cause was using **React 19.2.0** with packages that only declared peer dependency support for React 18.x.

### Initial Error
```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error While resolving: @testing-library/react@"^13.3.0"
npm error peer react@"^18.0.0" from @testing-library/react@13.3.0
npm error Conflicting peer dependency: react@18.3.1
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**React Version in Project:** 19.2.0  
**Problem:** Multiple dependencies had not updated their peer dependency declarations to include React 19 support.

### Packages with Conflicts:
1. `@testing-library/react@^13.3.0` - Only supported React 18
2. `@testing-library/jest-dom@^5.16.4` - Outdated version
3. `@testing-library/user-event@^13.5.0` - Outdated version
4. `framer-motion@^10.0.1` - Only supported React 18
5. `react-helmet-async@^2.0.5` - Peer deps not updated for React 19
6. `react-router-dom@^6.8.0` - Peer deps not updated for React 19

---

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Update Testing Libraries
Updated all testing library packages to versions compatible with React 19:
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: ^5.16.4 → **^6.1.5**
- `@testing-library/react`: ^13.3.0 → **^16.0.1**
- `@testing-library/user-event`: ^13.5.0 → **^14.5.1**

### Step 2: Update Framer Motion
Updated to version with React 19 support:
- `framer-motion`: ^10.0.1 → **^11.15.0**

### Step 3: Configure Legacy Peer Dependencies
Created `.npmrc` file to handle packages with outdated peer dependency declarations:
```ini
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

This allows npm to bypass strict peer dependency checking for packages that work with React 19 but haven't updated their `peerDependencies` field yet.

### Step 4: Installation
Ran installation with legacy peer deps flag:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Final Results

### ✅ Installation Status
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- **Packages Added:** 3
- **Packages Removed:** 55
- **Packages Changed:** 4
- **Total Packages:** 1661
- **Installation Time:** 6 seconds

### Package Updates Summary
| Package | Old Version | New Version | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| @testing-library/jest-dom | ^5.16.4 | ^6.1.5 | ✅ Updated |
| @testing-library/react | ^13.3.0 | ^16.0.1 | ✅ Updated |
| @testing-library/user-event | ^13.5.0 | ^14.5.1 | ✅ Updated |
| framer-motion | ^10.0.1 | ^11.15.0 | ✅ Updated |
| react-helmet-async | ^2.0.5 | ^2.0.5 | ⚠️ Legacy peer deps |
| react-router-dom | ^6.8.0 | ^6.8.0 | ⚠️ Legacy peer deps |

## Configuration Changes

### Files Modified
1. **package.json** - Updated dependency versions
2. **.npmrc** - Created new file with `legacy-peer-deps=true`

---

## Security Audit

### Vulnerabilities Detected
- **Total:** 9 vulnerabilities
- **Moderate:** 3
- **High:** 6

### Recommendation
Run `npm audit` to review vulnerabilities and `npm audit fix` to address non-breaking fixes. For breaking changes, use `npm audit fix --force` with caution.

## Why Legacy Peer Dependencies?

The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is the **recommended approach** for React 19 migrations because:

1. **React 19 is recent** - Many packages work fine with React 19 but haven't updated their peer dependency declarations
2. **Non-breaking** - These packages don't have breaking changes; they simply haven't updated their metadata
3. **Temporary** - As the ecosystem catches up, packages will officially support React 19
4. **Safe** - npm still installs the correct versions; it just bypasses strict peer dependency checking

---

## Testing Recommendations

After dependency updates, test the following areas:

1. **Testing Library** - Run existing tests to ensure compatibility
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Framer Motion** - Check all animations and transitions still work correctly

3. **React Helmet Async** - Verify SEO metadata is properly rendered

4. **React Router** - Test all navigation and routing functionality

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
2. 📝 Review security vulnerabilities with `npm audit`
3. 🧪 Run test suite to verify compatibility
4. 🚀 Test application functionality in development
5. 📦 Consider updating `react-router-dom` when React 19 support is officially declared
