## 🚨 Critical Issues Still To Fix

These are blocking production deployment:

1. **CORS Configuration** 🔴
   - API calls fail in production
   - Fix: Use backend as proxy
   - Time: 2 hours

2. **No Retry Logic** 🔴
   - Network failures lose all data
   - Fix: Implement exponential backoff
   - Time: 2 hours

3. **Missing Data Validation** 🟡
   - Bad data causes runtime errors
   - Fix: Add schema validation
   - Time: 3 hours
