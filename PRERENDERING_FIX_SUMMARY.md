# Next.js Prerendering Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed prerendering error for `/directory/essendon` page that was causing Vercel build failures.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Division by Zero Risk
- **Problem**: Average price calculation could result in division by zero if no stations had unleaded prices
- **Location**: Lines 47-50 and 83-86 in `src/app/directory/[suburb]/page.tsx`
- **Impact**: Could cause runtime errors during static generation

### 2. Unsafe Array Access
- **Problem**: Accessing `sortedStations[0]` without bounds checking
- **Location**: Line 118 in `src/app/directory/[suburb]/page.tsx`
- **Impact**: Could cause runtime errors if array is empty

### 3. Missing Null Safety Checks
- **Problem**: Insufficient null/undefined checks for station data properties
- **Location**: Throughout station mapping and data access
- **Impact**: Could cause runtime errors during prerendering

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Safe Average Price Calculation
```typescript
// Before (unsafe)
const avgPrice = stations
  .filter(s => s.fuelPrices.unleaded)
  .reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s.fuelPrices.unleaded || 0), 0) / stations.filter(s => s.fuelPrices.unleaded).length;

// After (safe)
const stationsWithUnleaded = stations.filter(s => s?.fuelPrices?.unleaded);
const avgPrice = stationsWithUnleaded.length > 0
  ? stationsWithUnleaded.reduce((sum, s) => sum + (s?.fuelPrices?.unleaded || 0), 0) / stationsWithUnleaded.length
  : 0;
```

### 2. Safe Array Access
```typescript
// Before (unsafe)
Lowest: <strong>{sortedStations[0].fuelPrices.unleaded?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A'}¢/L</strong>

// After (safe)
Lowest: <strong>{sortedStations.length > 0 ? (sortedStations[0].fuelPrices.unleaded?.toFixed(1) || 'N/A') : 'N/A'}¢/L</strong>
```

### 3. Enhanced Null Safety
```typescript
// Added comprehensive null checks throughout
const stations = (stationsData as Station[] || []).filter(
  (s) => s?.suburb?.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-') === suburb
).filter(Boolean); // Remove any null/undefined entries

// Safe station mapping
{sortedStations.map((station, index) => {
  // Safety check for station data
  if (!station || !station.id) return null;

  return (
    <article key={station.id}>
      {/* Safe property access with fallbacks */}
      <h2>{station.name || 'Unknown Station'}</h2>
      <span>{station.brand || 'Unknown Brand'}</span>
      {/* ... */}
    </article>
  );
})}
```

### 4. Safe Property Access
- Added null checks for all station properties
- Provided fallback values for missing data
- Enhanced fuel prices object access safety

## Build Results
✅ **Build Status**: SUCCESSFUL
✅ **Static Generation**: 323/323 pages generated successfully
✅ **No Runtime Errors**: All prerendering issues resolved

## Prevention Checklist

### For Future Development

1. **Always Use Null Safety**
   - Use optional chaining (`?.`) for object property access
   - Provide fallback values for potentially undefined data
   - Filter out null/undefined entries from arrays

2. **Safe Mathematical Operations**
   - Check for division by zero before calculations
   - Validate array lengths before accessing elements
   - Use conditional operators for safe operations

3. **Comprehensive Data Validation**
   - Validate data structure before processing
   - Add type guards for runtime safety
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

4. **Static Generation Best Practices**
   - Avoid browser-only APIs in server components
   - Use proper error boundaries
   - Test builds locally before deployment

5. **Environment-Specific Testing**
   - Test builds in both development and production environments
   - Use Vercel CLI for local production testing
   - Monitor build logs for potential issues

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add Error Boundaries
Consider adding error boundaries to catch and handle any remaining edge cases gracefully.

### 2. Data Validation
Implement runtime data validation using libraries like Zod to ensure data integrity.

### 3. Monitoring
Set up build monitoring to catch similar issues early in the deployment pipeline.

### 4. Testing
Add comprehensive tests for edge cases and data scenarios.

## Files Modified
- `src/app/directory/[suburb]/page.tsx` - Main fixes applied

## Build Verification
- ✅ Local build successful
- ✅ Static generation working
- ✅ No prerendering errors
- ✅ All 323 pages generated successfully

The prerendering error has been resolved and the application should now deploy successfully to Vercel.
