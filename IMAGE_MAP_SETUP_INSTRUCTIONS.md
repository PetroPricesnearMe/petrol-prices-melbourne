# Melbourne Image Map Setup Instructions

## What I've Implemented

I've successfully created a new image map implementation for your Melbourne regional map. Here's what has been done:

### 1. New Components Created
- **`src/components/MelbourneImageMap.js`** - New React component using HTML image maps
- **`src/components/MelbourneImageMap.css`** - Styling for the image map component
- **`public/test-image-map.html`** - Test page to verify image map functionality

### 2. Updated Files
- **`src/components/HomePage.js`** - Updated to use the new image map component instead of SVG
- **`public/service-worker.js`** - Added caching for the new JPG image

### 3. Image Map Coordinates Implemented
The image map uses the exact coordinates you provided:

```html
<map name="melbourne-regions-map">
    <area target="" alt="NORTHERN" title="NORTHERN SUBURBS" href="" coords="578,166,247" shape="circle">
    <area target="" alt="EASTERN" title="EASTERN SUBURBS" href="" coords="894,150,698,415,998,609,1005,483,1006,133,954,114,914,124" shape="poly">
    <area target="" alt="MELBOURNE" title="INNER MELBOURNE" href="" coords="519,419,661,432,738,492,556,516,452,463,427,396,466,405,486,415" shape="poly">
    <area target="" alt="SOUTH EAST" title="SOUTH EASTERN SUBURBS" href="" coords="699,720,635,545,773,537,916,591,969,690,935,730,766,792,757,842,756,898,588,999,547,961,634,828" shape="poly">
    <area target="" alt="WESTERN" title="WESTERN SUBURBS" href="" coords="185,153,103,233,74,457,127,577,231,587,331,520,400,392,300,223,292,164,241,128,216,136,205,145" shape="poly">
</map>
```

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Replace the Placeholder Image
Currently, I've created a placeholder `melbourne-map-vector.jpg` file. You need to:

1. **Upload your actual Melbourne map image** to `public/images/melbourne-map-vector.jpg`
2. **Ensure the image dimensions match the coordinates** you provided
3. **Test the coordinates** using the test page at `http://localhost:3000/test-image-map.html`

### 2. Test the Image Map
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test-image-map.html`
2. Click on each region to verify the coordinates are accurate
3. Check that each region highlights properly on hover

### 3. Verify Integration
1. Visit the homepage at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Scroll down to the map section
3. Test clicking on each region
4. Verify that clicking navigates to `/directory?region=<region_id>`

## Features of the New Implementation

### Interactive Features
- **Clickable regions** that navigate to the directory page with region filter
- **Hover effects** showing region information and station counts
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile and desktop
- **Accessibility support** with proper ARIA labels

### Visual Features
- **Region overlay** showing station counts when hovering
- **Smooth animations** using Framer Motion
- **Modern styling** matching your site's blue/green color theme
- **Loading states** for station count data

### Technical Features
- **Real-time data** integration with your existing data source
- **SEO friendly** with proper alt tags and titles
- **Performance optimized** with proper caching
- **Cross-browser compatible** HTML image maps

## Troubleshooting

### If coordinates don't match:
1. Open your image in an image editor
2. Check the actual dimensions
3. Adjust coordinates proportionally if needed
4. Test using the test page

### If regions don't highlight:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the image path is correct
3. Ensure the image loads properly
4. Test with different browsers

### If navigation doesn't work:
1. Check that React Router is working
2. Verify the region IDs match your directory page
3. Test the URL structure: `/directory?region=northern`

## Next Steps

Once you've uploaded the correct image and verified the coordinates:

1. **Remove the test file**: `public/test-image-map.html`
2. **Test on production**: Deploy and test the live site
3. **Monitor performance**: Check that the image map loads quickly
4. **User feedback**: Gather feedback on the new map interface

The implementation is complete and ready to use once you provide the correct image file!
