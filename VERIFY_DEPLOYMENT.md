## 🚨 **If Something's Wrong**

### **Symptom: Build Failed**
```bash
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Look for error message
3. Usually: Missing dependency or TypeScript error
4. Fix: Push fix to GitHub
```

### **Symptom: White Screen**
```bash
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red errors
3. Check if data files are accessible:
   https://your-site.vercel.app/data/stations.geojson
4. Verify environment variables are set
```

### **Symptom: 404 on Routes**
```bash
1. Check vercel.json has SPA routing:
   "routes": [{"src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html"}]
2. Already configured ✅
3. If still broken: Redeploy
```
