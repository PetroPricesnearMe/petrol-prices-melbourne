### **Step 1: Verify Deployment Status** (5 minutes)

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find project: **petrol-prices-melbourne**
   - Status should be: ‚úÖ **"Deployed"** (green)

   Production URL: https://[your-project].vercel.app
   Custom Domain: https://petrolpricesnearme.com.au (if configured)
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Environment Variables** (CRITICAL!)

Verify these are set in Vercel:

**Required Variables:**

```

**Optional (for AI Chat):**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
PPLX_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **If missing:** Add them ‚Üí Redeploy

---

### **Step 3: Test Your Live Site** (10 minutes)

Open your production URL and test:

**Homepage:**
- [ ] Hero section displays
- [ ] Region cards show correct station counts
- [ ] "Browse by Region" button works
- [ ] No console errors (F12)

**Region Navigation:**
- [ ] Click "Northern Suburbs" ‚Üí Goes to `/directory?region=northern`
- [ ] URL changes in browser

- [ ] No infinite spinner! ‚úÖ

**Directory Page:**
- [ ] Shows 700+ stations
- [ ] Search bar works
- [ ] Filters work (brand, region)
- [ ] Station cards display correctly
- [ ] Map loads (if Mapbox configured)

**Mobile Test:**
- [ ] Open on phone browser
- [ ] Tap region card ‚Üí navigates
- [ ] Responsive layout looks good
- [ ] No horizontal scroll

---

### **Step 4: Check for Errors** (5 minutes)

**Browser Console (F12 ‚Üí Console):**
```
‚úÖ Good Logs:
üó∫Ô∏è Loading stations from local GeoJSON...
‚úÖ Loaded 700+ stations from GeoJSON
‚úÖ Successfully loaded 700+ stations from local

‚ùå Bad Errors (Report to me):
Error loading stations
Failed to fetch
CORS error
```

**Vercel Function Logs:**
- Go to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí Functions
- Check for errors
- Should be minimal (static site, no serverless functions)

---

### **Step 5: Performance Check** (5 minutes)

**Run Lighthouse:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Run audit (Desktop + Mobile)

**Expected Scores:**
- Performance: 85+ ‚úÖ
- Accessibility: 90+ ‚úÖ
- Best Practices: 90+ ‚úÖ
- SEO: 95+ ‚úÖ

**Check Core Web Vitals:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- FID (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

## üêõ **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue 1: "Build Failed"**

**Symptoms:** Red "Failed" badge in Vercel

**Check:**
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Build logs
2. Look for errors

**Common Causes:**
```bash
# Missing dependencies
npm install

# TypeScript errors (shouldn't have any)
npm run build

# Out of memory
# Fix: Add to vercel.json:
{
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.js": {
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

---

### **Issue 2: "White Screen" / Blank Page**

**Symptoms:** Site loads but shows nothing

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Check browser console for errors
# 2. Verify environment variables are set
# 3. Check data files exist:
#    - /data/stations.geojson should be accessible
#    - Try: https://your-site.vercel.app/data/stations.geojson

# 4. If data missing, redeploy with correct files
```

---

### **Issue 3: "Infinite Spinner"**

**Symptoms:** LoadingSpinner never disappears

**We Fixed This!** But if it still happens:

1. Open browser console
2. Look for these logs:
   ```
   ‚è∞ LoadingSpinner TIMEOUT reached after 10000 ms
   ```
3. Check what request is hanging
4. Verify Baserow API credentials

---

### **Issue 4: "Region Links Don't Work"**

**Symptoms:** Clicking region cards does nothing

**We Fixed This Too!** But verify:

1. Open console
2. Click region card
3. Should see:
   ```
   üîó Region link clicked: northern
   üìç Navigation URL: /directory?region=northern
   ```
4. If no logs: Clear cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

---

### **Issue 5: "404 Not Found" on Sub-Routes**

**Symptoms:** `/directory` shows 404

**Fix:** Verify `vercel.json` has correct routing:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This makes all routes go through React Router.
